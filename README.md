#CIPHAR-10Image Classification using Neural Networks and Statistical methods like KNN and Bayes Classifiers:
Using the CIPHAR-10 dataset we analyse and compare the difference between CNN, KNN and Bayes Classifier. The CIPHAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes. The purpose is to identify which method is more effective for image classification tasks, which can have practical applications in computer vision.
